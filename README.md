## k-NN_&_Logistic_Regression

The purpose of this project is to focus on investigating the k-nearest neighbors algorithm comprehensively, and also examine the difference between the k-Means clustering algorithm and the k-NN algorithm. We will look into the pros, cons, and performances between k-NN and other classification algorithms (ex. Logistic Regression Algorithm).
